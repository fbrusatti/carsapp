Este sería el backlog del proyecto, fijense que le pueden agregar o quitar y lo vamos charlando. Las oraciones que tienen ** son las que 
agregué y le coloque los puntos teniendo en cuenta como se habían colocado en las que tienen * que son las que habiamos hecho en clase. 
Recuerden que cada punto representa 2hs de trabajo, y creo que habían dicho que hicieramos alrededor de 10 puntos, pero bueno después lo 
vemos.
